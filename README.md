# ESN-Project
Enterprise Social Networking Project

My idea is to make simple ESN site, which contains the core functions that real ESN software has.

Connected firebase to the project and I'm using redux to have "one source of truth".
Database is created and can be found in main folder ("database.json"), exactly same json file is hosted on firebase from where data is provided to the store

Still styling has to be done.
