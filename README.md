# ESN-Project
Enterprise Social Networking Project

My idea is to make simple ESN site, which contains the core functions that real ESN software has.

Now, I'm having issues with handling the data through the react router, so I'm learning REDUX.
    For now I made simple exporting from .js files to just simulate real database and data handling.

Still styling has to be done.
